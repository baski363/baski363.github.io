I received my Ph.D in Industrial Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2007 and my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras in 2002. I am primarily interested in solving combinatorial optimization problems modeled on networks and applications of integer programming. This has led me into diverse domains including computational biology, social network analysis, and graph-based data mining, as well as classical areas of operations research like transportation logistics, production-inventory planning, and scheduling. 

My research has been sponsored by National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Office of Naval Research, and industry partners. Publications coauthored with my students and other collaborators have appeared in _Operations Research_, _INFORMS Journal on Computing_, _INFORMS Journal on Optimization_, and _INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics_, among others. I serve on the editorial boards of _Networks_ (Wiley) and _Journal of Global Optimization_ (Springer).
